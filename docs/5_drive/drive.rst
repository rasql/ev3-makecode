Driving
=======

The EV3 has special commands for controlling the two large motors for moving the robot around.


Use the EV3 buttons to drive
----------------------------

First we display a small user guide on the EV3 display.

At this point we can test the display and the presence of the two large motors.

Move forward and backwards
--------------------------

The robot moves forward if both motors turn forward (50%) at the same speed.
The robot moves backward if both motors turn backward (-50%) together.
